# 3D-DCGAN-medical-image-synthesis
Final project for Seminars in _Advanced Topics in Computer Science_'s Course 2019/2020 at Sapienza (Machine Learning and Features Extraction module).

This work implements a few 3D Deep Convolutional GANs for medical image synthesis inspired to [Medical Image Synthesis with Deep
Convolutional Adversarial Networks](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8310638) (2018). Visitors are encouraged to check the authors' current work at [https://github.com/ginobilinie/medSynthesisV1](https://github.com/ginobilinie/medSynthesisV1).

**DISCLAIMER**: this project is intended for educational purposes only.
This work is the prosecution of my previous GitHub repository ([https://github.com/brakes312t4/cGAN-medical-image-synthesis](https://github.com/brakes312t4/cGAN-medical-image-synthesis)), where only simplified 2D versions of the DCGANs were implemented.

### Google Drive Code
The project was developed with Google Colab, thus the code is stored on Google Drive at [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14yzugfK46JyHDUnZKCTyVH0cdhPoc2rE?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14yzugfK46JyHDUnZKCTyVH0cdhPoc2rE?usp=sharing).
